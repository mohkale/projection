;;; Commentary:

;; This library exposes a target generation function for `compile-multi' allows
;; building, running and testing go packages.

;;; Code:

(require 'projection-multi)
(require 'projection-types)
(require 'projection-type-golang)

;;;###autoload
(defun projection-multi-golang-targets (&optional project-type)
  "`compile-multi' target generator function for Golang projects.
When set the generated targets will be prefixed with PROJECT-TYPE."
  (setq project-type (or project-type "golang"))

  (cl-loop
   for (short-name . package) in (projection-golang--list-packages)
   collect (cons (concat project-type ":" short-name)
                 (projection-golang--command 'run package))))

;;;###autoload
(defun projection-multi-compile-golang ()
  "`compile-multi' wrapper for only golang targets."
  (interactive)
  (projection-multi-compile--run
   (projection--current-project 'no-error)
   `((t ,#'projection-multi-golang-targets))))
