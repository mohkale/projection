;;; Commentary:

;; Helpers for calling `compile-multi' with project specific targets.
;;
;; This library exposes a command `projection-multi-compile' which invokes
;; `compile-multi' with a project specific compilation targets. This includes
;; targets for available commands for the current project type (configure,
;; compile, etc. See `projection-commands') and also for build frameworks
;; included in the current project. For example `projection-multi-compile'
;; will include tox targets when the project matches the tox project type.
;; This latter feature works independently of the main project type associated
;; with the current project. A project matching both tox and CMake will
;; offer both tox and CMake targets with `projection-multi-compile'.

;;; Code:

(require 'compile-multi)
(require 'projection-commands)

(defgroup projection-multi nil
  "Project type integration for `compile-multi'."

  :group 'compile-multi)

(defcustom projection-multi-extend-existing-config t
