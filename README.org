Project type support for Emacs builtin ~project.el~.

#+html: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23294780/268754300-152f0bcc-7423-4bf7-a52c-350cc52f69d3.gif" align="middle" />

This Emacs package provides a [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][Projectile]] like project management library atop Emacs
built-in ~project.el~. The end goal is to provide a stable and reliable out-of-the-box
project management experience for as many project types as possible while supporting
very targeted support for some project types like [[https://cmake.org/][CMake]].

* The Why?
  Projectile is *fantastic!* The out of the box experience is amazing, but it's also
  quite overbearing. Currently projectile has almost 6000 lines of source code all
  contained in a single file. This includes cross-platform facilities for detecting
  the current project root, definitions for numerous project types, and a myriad of
  helper functions (such as a pluggable TAGS table back-end, or wrappers across other
  Emacs commands or packages with the sole amendment being they run in the project
  root). Suffice it to say I think projectile is /spread a little too thin and trying
  to do way too much/. This is a consequence of it evolving naturally from a time when
  Emacs had poor built-in project support. Going forward I expect more packages to
  start using the new built-in Emacs ~project.el~ and Projectile becoming yet-another
  pluggable backend for it. In that vein this project is simply trying to migrate
  over the minimum feature set I find valuable from Projectile for my personal use.
  Where possible I do also try to improve on features. For example Projectile doesn't
  support binding an interactive function as a compilation command (like
  ~rustic-compile~) but Projection does.

  *Note*: If any part of this description is no longer up-to-date please open a PR to
  discuss updating it :-).

* Installation
** Manually
   1. Clone the repo.
   2. Add the src and/or the src/projection-multi path to your Emacs ~load-path~.
   3. Load it when needed.

** MELPA
   Projection and any extension packages are on [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa][MELPA]]. You can add this to your
   ~package-archives~ variable and then install through ~M-x package-install~.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (push '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") package-archives)
     (package-refresh-contents)
     (package-install 'projection)
     (package-install 'projection-multi)
   #+end_src

* Quickstart
  Must of projection is optional. By default projection does not do anything, not
  even bind any keys (although it does provide a map to make this more convenient).
  Here's a base configuration that will enable ALL the feature of projection out of
  the box. See [[*Features][Features]] for a list of features.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package projection
      :ensure t
      ;; Enable the `projection-hook' feature.
      :hook (after-init . global-projection-hook-mode)

      ;; Require projections immediately after project.el.
      :config
      (with-eval-after-load 'project
        (require 'projection))

      ;; Access pre-configured projection commands from a keybinding of your choice.
      ;; Run `M-x describe-keymap projection-map` for a list of available commands.
      :bind-keymap
      ("C-x P" . projection-map))

    (use-package projection-multi
      :ensure t
      ;; Allow interactively selecting available compilation targets from the current
      ;; project type.
      :init
      (define-key global-map "RET" #'projection-multi-compile))

    (use-package projection-multi-embark
      :ensure t
      :after embark
      :after projection-multi
      :demand t
      ;; Add the projection set-command bindings to `compile-multi-embark-command-map'.
      :config (projection-multi-embark-setup-command-map))
  #+end_src

* Features
** Projection Commands
   This feature works just like projectiles ~projectile-compile-project~ family of
   commands. Each project can optionally expose one of the following command types
   and you can use the associated =projection-commands-TYPE-project= command to
   invoke it interactively.

   | Type      | Description                                               |
   |-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
   | Configure | Run any pre-configure steps such as generating Makefiles. |
   | Build     | Compile the project.                                      |
   | Test      | Run any configured tests for the current project.         |
   | Run       | Run the project (for example: Starting a game).           |
   | Package   | Produce a package from the built project.                 |
   | Install   | Install the packaged project into an install directory.   |

   At any point you can customize or override what command to run for these
   command-types by passing a prefix argument (=C-u=) to the command. The command you
   enter will be cached so subsequent attempts to run the same command-type will use
   the same command. You can reset to the project defaults with =M-x
   projection-reset-project-cache=.

   *Note*: Projection supports both shell-commands, interactive functions and helper
   functions which can return either of these as valid targets for each of these
   commands. This means, for example, we can support using rustic-modes builtin
   compilation commands and fallback to basic shell-commands when those aren't
   defined. See [[file:src/projection-types.el][projection-types]] for how this is configured.

** Projection Hook
   Provides a more general purpose parallel to ~projectile-toggle-project-read-only~.
   With this you can hook certain functions (Example: ~read-only-mode~) into a project
   and retroactively apply it to both all the open buffers from that project and any
   new buffers that will be opened in it.

** Projection ibuffer
   Offers variants of ~projectile-ibuffer~ and the [[https://github.com/purcell/ibuffer-projectile][ibuffer-projectile]] project in the
   form of =ibuffer-projection-current-project= and =ibuffer-projection-set-filter-groups=.
   The former creates and displays a dedicated ibuffer window for only buffers in the
   current project. The latter pre-pends filters to group by a specific project for
   all currently open projects.

** Projection Find
   Adds facilities for jumping to related files within a project. The most common use
   case for this would be jumping between C++ header ~.h~ and implementation ~.cpp~ files.
   This is already possible with Emacs's builtin =ff-find-other-file= command but
   projection builds on top of it by supporting jumping to related files in other
   directories or with alterations to the file-name beyond extensions. For example if
   you have header files in an include directory and implementation files in a src
   directory then =projection-find-other-file= can still jump between them without any
   extra configuration. If you're working on a python project and define test files
   with a ~test_BASENAME.py~ format then ~projection-find-other-file~ can also jump
   between ~BASENAME.py~ and ~test_BASENAME.py~. ~projection-find-other-file~ is intended to
   be a consistent and transitive command. You can invoke it repeatedly to cycle
   between related files and the order in which you cycle will be consistent
   independent of which file you're currently in.

   General associations between the current files extension and possible related file
   extensions is configured in =projection-find-other-file-suffix=. Supported suffixes
   and prefixes for test files is configured by the project-type in
   [[file:src/projection-types.el]].

** Projection recentf
   A variant of =M-x recentf= for files exclusively in the current project.

** Projection multi-compile

   [[https://github.com/mohkale/compile-multi][compile-multi]] is a multi target interface to =M-x compile=. It allows you to
   configure and interactively select compilation targets based on arbitrary
   projects.

   Projection has an optional extension package called =projection-multi-compile= to
   integrate =compile-multi= into the current project type. It can extract available
   compilation targets from Makefiles, CMake configuration, etc. and let you execute
   them easily. By default =projection-multi-compile= determines all project types
   matching the current project and then resolves compilation targets based on them.
   For example a project that would match CMake and tox would let you select both tox
   environments and CMake build targets.

   Each target generation function in projection-multi also supports being run
   independently. To select a tox task you can run =M-x projection-multi-compile-tox=,
   and you won't be presented with CMake or any other target types. This bypasses
   project type matching altogether and so may present targets not normally
   discovered by =projection-multi-compile=.

   Currently automatic target generation functions are available for the following
   project types:

   - projection (This simply presents available [[*Projection Commands][commands]] for the matching project types)
   - CMake (& CTest)
   - Make
   - Poetry Poe
   - Tox


** Projection multi-embark
#+html: <p align="right">
#+html: <a href="https://melpa.org/#/projection-multi-embark"><img alt="MELPA" src="https://melpa.org/packages/projection-multi-embark-badge.svg"/></a>
#+html: </p>

  Add embark integration to multi-compile using the [[https://github.com/mohkale/compile-multi#compile-multi-embark][multi-compile-embark]] extension
  feature. This allows you to immediately set one of the candidates show in a
  compile-multi session as the projects build, configure, etc. command type. Use this
  to interactively and incrementally update build targets.

** Specialised Project Support
   Currently projection has very extensive support for certain project types. This
   tries to bind Emacs a little stronger into the framework and bring more IDE like
   support for extending the project builds. This section documents some of the extra
   support available.

*** CMake
    For CMake projects projection supports the following extensions:

    - =projection-cmake-set-preset= - Interactively sets a preset for a given
      build-type in the current project. By default if a project has any supported
      presets for a build-type projection will automatically prompt you for which to
      use and then cache it for subsequent invocations. See =projection-cmake-preset=
      to set an alternative preset behaviour for your use case.
    - =projection-cmake-set-build-type= - Alter the value of the =CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=
      option passed through to CMake while configuring.
    - Target resolution through the [[https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.15/manual/cmake-file-api.7.html][CMake file API]]. This is disabled by default but
      can be enabled by customizing =projection-cmake-target-backend= (for example:
      =(setq projection-cmake-target-backend 'code-model)=) and then re-configuring the
      project.

* Configuration
** Permanently Configuring Project Types
   Project types are eioio objects. Every project type currently supported by
   projection has a =defvar= to allow you to modify it. For example you can override
   the default compilation command run for a given project by overriding the build
   attribute:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; Change the test command for dotnet projects.
     (oset projection-project-type-dotnet test "dotnet lint")
     ;; Unset the build command for dotnet projects.
     (oset projection-project-type-dotnet build nil)
   #+end_src

   To remove a project type from the configuration list altogether you can delete it
   from =projection-project-types=.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (delq projection-project-type-cmake projection-project-types)
   #+end_src
